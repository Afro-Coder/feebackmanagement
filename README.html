FeedBack Management System

This project is not meant to be used in Production. It was a part of my TYBsc.IT Project.

=========
Synopsis
=========
> This project was used to take feedback of teachers from students. 
> The main goal was to learn the Flask Framework and to understand how MVC works in Python.
> The secondary goal from the security viewpoint was to not let a user submit twice.
> Used hashid's to hash user's submissions.


===================
Learning Objectives
===================
> Used a Postgres Database over MySQL.
> Used SQLAlchemy ORM over traditional SQL queries (Would still prefer SQL queries with santization)
> Used Jinja2 Templating(Had fun with the blocks part, made templates reusable. Still not much logic should be applied to the Design Part)
> Used RBAC (Role Based Auth) for users.
> Used FLASK-ADMIN as a blueprint rather than a standalone.
> Learned a lot of JQuery based Ajax calls and manipulating data in the front end.

=============
Requirements
============
> For python; run pip install -r final_requirements.txt
> Postgres Database was used. For development you can use SQlite3

How to use
=============
1. Create a virtualenv directory
2. Install flasktools.py by using "pip install -e  ."
3. Edit config.py with the secret key and admin email
4. Run  flasktools initdb
5. Run flasktools run
6. Open browser and run
7. Before creating a normal user a admin user has to be created (Few of the things are manual in this and it was a part of the improvement process which I never got to do as the project was discontinued.)
6. Run  sqlite3 <dbname> || run "insert into roles values(1,'admin').
